# The CTO’s Growth Playbook

If product is the engine, then engineering is the drivetrain — it converts potential energy into forward motion. High‑leverage CTOs translate technical capacity into compounding business results: faster learning cycles, higher margins, and durable moat.

> The job: make growth inevitable by reducing the cost of change.

## Part I — Principles that Compound

- Bias to small, reversible bets; scale only what proves valuable.
- Shorten feedback loops between idea → user → metrics → iteration.
- Build paved roads (defaults) so average teams produce excellent outcomes.
- Optimize for developer time in the critical path to revenue.

### From Tech KPIs to Business Results

| Technical KPI | Why it matters | Business Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lead time to production | Faster idea validation | Higher hit‑rate on roadmap |
| Change failure rate | Stability at speed | Lower churn, fewer incidents |
| MTTR | Graceful degradation | Trust, reduced downtime cost |
| Test coverage of critical paths | Safer refactors | Feature velocity sustains |

## Part II — Operating System for a High‑Leverage Org

### 1) Product Engineering Cadence

- Weekly planning: outcomes, not output. Link every item to a metric.
- Daily: small batches, PRs under ~300 lines, auto‑merge on green.
- Friday demo: ship or show. Record learnings, not just features.

### 2) Architecture for Speed

- Modular boundaries around business capabilities.
- Event‑driven contracts and schema evolution over tight coupling.
- Strict “no shared database” across bounded contexts.

```ts
// Example: anti-corruption layer for payments domain
export interface PaymentRequest {
  amountCents: number;
  currency: "USD" | "EUR";
  customerId: string;
}

export async function charge(request: PaymentRequest) {
  // map internal model -> provider DTO
  // retry idempotently with exponential backoff
}
```

### 3) Guardrails > Gatekeepers

- CI as quality platform: type checks, unit+contract tests, preview envs.
- Scorecards per service (DORA + error budget + SLO adherence).
- Golden paths for auth, storage, messaging; auto‑generated examples.

## Part III — Metrics that Matter

- North stars: Activation, Retention, Expansion, Efficiency (AREE).
- Engineering levers: lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, CFR.
- Cost lens: infra unit economics and build time per developer.

> If you can’t see it, you can’t improve it. Invest in observability early.

## Part IV — People, Levels, Hiring

- Hire for learning speed and systems thinking over stack trivia.
- Leveling anchors: scope, autonomy, impact; make promotions predictable.
- Staff+ track: architecture as a service; align roadmaps to business bets.

### Interview Signal Map

- System design → boundary clarity, tradeoffs, cost awareness.
- Execution → iteration habits, testing strategy, debugging approach.
- Collaboration → concise writing, PR hygiene, stakeholder empathy.

## Part V — Playbook (30/60/90)

- [ ] 30: baseline DORA, error budgets, cost dashboard; remove 3 chronic toil items.
- [ ] 60: paved road v1 (CI templates, preview envs, service skeletons).
- [ ] 90: 2x lead time reduction on a critical product area; incident review cadence.

## Case Study — From Slow to Snowball

Context: B2B SaaS, 12 engineers, long QA cycles, incident‑prone releases. We introduced trunk‑based development with progressive delivery, contract tests for third‑party APIs, and a hard budget for flaky tests. Lead time dropped from 14 days to 2, CFR fell from 28% to 6%, and NRR grew 8 pts in two quarters.

> Small batches + paved roads + ruthless focus on feedback loops = momentum.

## Part VI — Anti‑Patterns

- “Rewrite to go faster” without metrics → 6–12 months of value vacuum.
- “We need microservices” — when what you need is modularity and tests.
- “Architects who don’t ship” — decisions detached from reality.
- Shadow product work that bypasses outcomes and learning.

## Part VII — Toolkit

- Decision records (ADRs) for architectural changes.
- RFCs for cross‑team proposals; timebox reviews to 72 hours.
- Runbooks attached to alerts; chaos drills quarterly.

### References & Next Steps

- Start with one stream‑aligned team; implement the paved road with them.
- Instrument your top 3 flows end‑to‑end; track pain per deploy.
- Schedule monthly “systems review” with product and finance — align bets to margins and learning speed.

_Great CTOs don’t just scale systems; they scale outcomes._

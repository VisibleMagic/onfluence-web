# A Shy CEO Steps Into the Spotlight

They built world-class batteries used by brands you know — but almost no one knew them. The company avoided the press for years. The CEO preferred to operate quietly. Meanwhile, competitors controlled the narrative.

We were asked to change that — carefully, credibly, and without turning the CEO into a caricature.

> From silent to sought-after — a measured PR system that earns attention.

## Diagnosis

- Strong technology moat; weak story and visibility
- Media wary of corporate speak; few memorable takes
- No press kit, no speaking track, no editorial rhythm

## Strategy

1) Narrative and Messaging
- Defined three pillars: energy reliability, responsible scale, and supply chain truth
- Crafted talk tracks with proof points and quotable lines

2) CEO Readiness
- Media training with scenario drills and bridging techniques
- Built a personal lane: pragmatic, data-led, calm authority

3) Press Engine
- Created a fast press kit: bio, headshots, fact sheet, product visuals, B-roll
- Sequenced outreach around owned milestones and timely industry hooks

4) Owned Editorial Rhythm
- Monthly executive note, factory diary series, customer impact spotlights
- Social amplification: LinkedIn long-form + short clips; measured, consistent cadence

## Execution

- Month 1: Narrative lock, press kit, CEO coaching
- Month 2–3: First briefings under embargo, contributed op-eds, factory tour invites
- Month 4–6: Tier-1 coverage, keynote acceptance, analyst citations

## Results

- Press: Consistent coverage across trade and business press
- Share of voice: From background mentions to quoted expert
- Speaking: Keynotes and panels at two industry conferences
- Pipeline: Inbound from new partners citing press features

## What Worked

- Tie announcements to broader energy and supply narratives

## Your Playbook

- Build a press kit before outreach
- Draft three memorable lines per pillar and practice them
- Anchor outreach to real milestones; offer data, not adjectives

> Credibility compounds. Start measured, then scale your voice.
